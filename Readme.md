There are two different directories containing Matlab codes with different purposes:

The directory KZ-Picker contains a straight forward Matlab code to calibrate and select knickpoints as described in Neely et al., 2017. Only Matlab, Topotoolbox and this code are required.

The directory KZ-Topo-Picker contains a more extensive Matlab code that generates several figures, maps, plots, longitudinal river profiles, shapefiles and additional data. However, this code requires installing addons (Ghostscript, GDAL, Topotoolbox, and scripts from Mathworks) to be fully functioning. This is intended for users with experience in DEM processing and knowledge in Matlab.

Both codes run on all operating systems and have been tested with various versions of Matlab.
