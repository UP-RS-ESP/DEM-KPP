## Example Datasets
We provide several example DEMs. For an example on demonstrating the calibration procedure, we refer the detailed manual available at [KZ_picker_instructions_ABN_7-8-17.pdf](KZ_picker_instructions_ABN_7-8-17.pdf). This describes the calbriation and processing steps as performed by the https://github.com/UP-RS-ESP/DEM-KZP/blob/master/KZ-Picker.

An example data including calibration files is available for the the Smugglers catchment for Santa Cruz Island:

1. _smugglers_1m_dem.7z_ at [SCI-1m-Smugglers](SCI-1m-Smugglers). An example dataset at containing a 1-m DEM of the northern part of Santa Cruz Island, southern California. The example GeoTIF with calibration files are available at https://www.dropbox.com/s/bkws9fsmv3hz7w1/KZ_picker_smugglers_EX.7z?dl=0 or https://boxup.uni-potsdam.de/index.php/f/38210279
