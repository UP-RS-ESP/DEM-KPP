# DEM-KZP
Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and KnickZone Picker (KZP) processing

Code developed by Al Neely and Bodo Bookhagen 10/12/2015, significantly
modified March-May 2016, and May 2017

The code has been tested with Matlab R2012b, R2014b and R2015b, R2016b, R2017a. 
It requires the Statistical Toolbox, the Topotoolbox, and 
export_fig (see below). If the Curve Fitting 
Toolbox is available, it will be used (_smooth_). If no Curve Fitting 
Toolbox is available, _sgolayfilt_ is used (with similar and comparable 
results).

*Installation*

Before running the code and taking advantage of all feautres (i.e.,
high-resolution figures and projected shapefile), you will need to
install the additional items:

1. _TopoToolbox_ (https://topotoolbox.wordpress.com/download/). I suggest
using the github repository
(https://github.com/wschwanghart/topotoolbox). For additional
information, see: https://topotoolbox.wordpress.com/.
The TopoToolbox requires the Image Processing Toolbox and the Statistics
Toolbox (which are mostly installed in academic environment). 
The Mapping Toolbox will come in handy, but is not required. The Curve 
Fitting Toolbox will be used if available and will produce slightly
different fitting parameters, e.g. (for 95% confidence Intervals).
Make sure to add the Topotoolbox to the Matlab PATH.

2. _export_fig_ from Mathworks MATLAB Central:
(http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export-fig)
for creating the various plots and figures in high-quality PDF format.
Make sure to add the location of the file export_fig.m to the Matlab PATH.

3. Install _ghostscript_ from
http://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html . This is required for 
high-res PDF outputs for export_fig.m and highly recommended.

4. _OSGEO4WShell_ or the full GDAL suite (http://www.gdal.org/ or 
http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/). MAC OS X users should install the GDAL 
complete framwork from http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks. 
This will allow to generate shapefiles from  
tables that are created during the processing and will allow to
polygonize raster (TIF) files. GDAL is freely available for all operating
systems, and we have tested this on Ubuntu 12.04
(sudo apt-get install gdal), Windows 7 and 8.1 
(http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/), and
Mac OS X (http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks). This script will
run well, if you use the default gdal installation options. Otherwise,
you may have to change the directory locations in the parameter file.
We rely on: _ogr2ogr_, _gdalsrsinfo_, _gdal_dem_,
_gdal_polygonize_.

5. Install the _KnickZonePicker_ (KZP) code and subdirectories and add
the KZP directory to the Matlab PATH. You can use _addpath_ or the GUI.


This Matlab code takes MAT file written by
_KZP_topometrics_v1.m_ and calculates knickpoints and
additional attributes from _chi-plot_ analysis. It will write several
shapefiles and csv files that can be read into any GIS software.

You will have to run _knickpoints_preprocessing_v1.m_ at least once before
running this script.

Parameters for this script can be adjusted/changed in
_knickpoints_parameters_X.m_.

This file will output the following four shapefiles:

  1: <filename>_kp_bases.shp (knickpoint bases for all tributaries)
  
  2: <filename>_kp_lips.shp (knickpoint lips for all tributaries)
  
  3: <filename>_kp_bases_trunk.shp (knickpoint bases for trunk stream)
  
  4: <filename>_kp_lips_trunk.shp (knickpoint lips for trunk stream)


The code developes a database/csv file/shapefile for the bottom and top
points of all knickzones. Each database has the following attributes with
their respective attribute name in brackets [].

Knickpoint Database information [shapefile attribute]

  1: knickpoint # [1kp_id]
  
  2: stream id # [2stream_id]
  
  3: tributary id # [3trib_id]
  
  4: slope of stream, bfl slope: elev/chi [4sl_str]
  
  5: chi coordinate [5chi]
  
  6: elevation (m) [6elev_m]
  
  7: knickpoint magnitude, detrended elevation drop (m) [7kp_magnt]
  
  8: Knickpoint Relief, height of knickpoint (not detrended (m)) [8kp_Rel]

  10: northing (meters utm) [10North_m]
  
  11: upstream drainage area (m2) [11DA_m2]

  12: dist upstream (m) [12kp_DFM]

  13: knickpoint slope (elev drop/distance upstream) [13kp_slp]

  14: elevation drop (detrended elevation drop/distance upstream, m) [14kp_slp_d]

  15: knickpoint slope (detrended elevation drop/chi) [15kp_slp_dt/c]

  16: knickpoint length (distance usptream, m) [16kp_len_m]

  17: sgolay smoothing window size (grid cells) [17sgol_smv]

  21: minimum steepness anomaly [21kp_stp_a]

  22: minimum stream size for analysis (cells) [22strea_sz]

#In order to process a DEM and identify Knickpoints, follow these steps:
(1) Load DEM file and other data from preprocessing
KZP_processing_1load_v1

(2) Iterate through all basin tributaries and extract knickpoints
KZP_processing_2kpp_tribs

(3) Iterate through all trunk streams and pull out knickpoints
KZP_processing_3kpp_trunks

(4) Generate figures for each basin
KZP_processing_4kpp_mkfigs
