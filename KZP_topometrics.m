% Automatic Stream Pre-Processing and extracting of topometric parameters
% By Bodo Bookhagen (bodo.bookhagen@uni-potsdam.de) 11/09/2015, 05/22/2017
%
% The code has been tested with R2012b, R2014a, R2014b, R2015b, R2016a. Note that
% older versions of Matlab (e.g., R2012b) use a slightly different set of
% instructions and code segments (see variable MATLABV in parameter file).
%
% *Installation*
%
% Before running the code and taking advantage of all feautres (i.e.,
% high-resolution figures and projected shapefile), you will need to
% install the additional items:
%
% 1. _TopoToolbox_ (https://topotoolbox.wordpress.com/download/). I suggest
% using the github repository
% (https://github.com/wschwanghart/topotoolbox). For additional
% information, see: https://topotoolbox.wordpress.com/.
% The TopoToolbox requires the Image Processing Toolbox and the Statistics
% Toolbox (which are mostly installed in academic environment).
% The Mapping Toolbox will come in handy, but is not required. The Curve
% Fitting Toolbox will be used if available and will produce slightly
% different fitting parameters, e.g. (for 95% confidence Intervals).
% Make sure to add the Topotoolbox to the Matlab PATH.
%
% 2. _export_fig_ from Mathworks MATLAB Central:
% (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export-fig)
% for creating the various plots and figures in high-quality PDF format.
% Make sure to add the location of the file export_fig.m to the Matlab PATH.
%
% 3. Install _ghostscript_ from
% http://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html . This is required for
% high-res PDF outputs for export_fig.m and highly recommended.
%
% 4. _OSGEO4WShell_ or the full GDAL suite (http://www.gdal.org/ or
% http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/). MAC OS X users should install the GDAL
% complete framwork from http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks.
% This will allow to generate shapefiles from
% tables that are created during the processing and will allow to
% polygonize raster (TIF) files. GDAL is freely available for all operating
% systems, and we have tested this on Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 16.04
% (sudo apt-get install gdal), Windows 7 and 8.1
% (http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/), and
% Mac OS X (http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks). This script will
% run well, if you use the default gdal installation options. Otherwise,
% you may have to change the directory locations in the parameter file.
% We rely on: _ogr2ogr_, _gdalsrsinfo_, _gdal_dem_,
% _gdal_polygonize_.
%
% 5. Install the _KnickZone-Picker_ (KZP) code and subdirectories via github (and add
% the KZP directory to the Matlab PATH.
%
%
% *Processing*
%
% BEFORE using your DEM with this script, make sure that you use a
% projected coordinate system. We strongly suggest to use UTM or other
% coordinate system with equal areas (or nearly equal areas) for all
% pixels. The geographic coordinate system that most SRTM data come in are
% no projections and the x and y length of each pixel differ (higher
% distortion with greater distance from the equator).
%
% This pre-processing script assumes there is a DEM_MAT_parameters.mat file
% in the current directory. You can create this file (a list of parameters)
% with: KZP_parameters_1m_example.m
% We advise to store this parameter file in the local directory where youe
% DEM GeoTIF file is located. All other Matlab code should be in a separate
% directory and you the paths to this should be included in the Matlab
% PATH.
%
% This script will check if files exists (geotiff, shapefile, plots) and
% will not-regenerate them, unless you specify the REGEN flag in the
% parameter file. Thus, if you would like to re-process your
% files and re-generate figures and shapefiles, set REGEN to 1 (0 by
% default).
%
% The script will write the following shapefiles:
%
% 1. <filename>_all_MS_proj.shp
%
% 2. <filename>_1e+06_MS_proj.shp (or other drainage area thresholds)
%
% 3. <filename>_db_stats_CNTR.shp
%
% 4. <filename>_db_stats_OUT.shp
%
% 5. <filename>_ridgecrest_MS.shp
%
% 6. <filename>_ridgecrest_MS_Dy_mean_1std.shp
%
% 7. <filename>_ridgecrest_MS_Dy_mean_2std.shp
%
% 8. <filename>_ridgecrest_MS_Dy_parab_1std.shp
%
% 9. <filename>_ridgecrest_MS_Dy_cosh2_1std.shp
%
% 10. <filename>_ridgecrest_MS_Dy_cosh4_1std.shp
%
% 11. in the directory _trunk_ there will be files
% <filename>_MS_trunk_ksn_db1_proj.shp with consecutive numbers for each
% identified trunk stream in the study area.
%
% 12. in the directory _STO_ (stream order) there will be files
% <filename>_STO_02_db_stats_CNTR.shp and
% <filename>_STO_02_db_stats_OUT.shp for the centroid and outlet
% coordinate. The number after _STO_ indicates the stream order and can be
% defined in the parameter file.
%
%
% The files in the folder shapefiles for the _ridgecrest_ contain
% attributes to decipher ridgecrest anomalies. These are:
%
% 1. 1ID
%
% 2. 2X - X Coordinate
%
% 3. 3Y - Y Coordinate
%
% 4. 4Area - Drainage area in m^2
%
% 5. 5dist_Dy1 or 5dist_Dy1 - Distance along ridgecrest profile where
% \Delta elevation exceeded a threshold value (1 or 2 sigma)
%
% 6. 6elevi_nrm - normalized elevation (between 0 - outlet and 1 - highest
% point)
%
% 7. 7Dy1_mn, 7Dy1_parab, 7Dy1_cosh2, 7Dy1_cosh4, or 7Dy2_mn - \Delta
% elevation values ouytside a threshold with respect to the overall
% 1-std.dev. mean (_mn), parabula, cosh *2, cosh * 4, or 2-std. dev. mean.
