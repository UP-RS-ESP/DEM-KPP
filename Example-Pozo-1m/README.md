# Example for running a KZP analysis on a 1-m DEM

We rely on the DEM from the Pozo catchment in the southwestern part of the Santa Cruz Island, south-central California. The DEM was generated from a U.S.G.S. lidar dataset.
The 1-m DEM is available here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/flb1h68m1b8buly/Pozo_DTM_noveg_UTM11_NAD83_1m.tif?dl=0
